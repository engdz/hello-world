Excitement Abound! 

Finally getting started with getting a toolkit together. I have been learning web development for the last year and a half and would love to gain more experience. Immersing myself in books and courses is the first step, the second step is creating something beautiful and infomrative/resourceful. I'm excited to organize all my projects on GitHub.
